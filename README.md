# Twig
A social media website clone

## Description
This is a social media website created using php with no libraries. The goal of this was a learning process for myself and the reason it is posted is to help anyone else who might want to make there own to learn more about databases and how php interacts with them.
Please note this project will not work out of the box. The ip addresses and password encrypting have been changed from the actual website. Also there is a font folder missing from this project as you will have to pick your own font.
